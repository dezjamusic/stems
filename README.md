# Stems

The main part of my music consists of MIDI notes for the virtual instruments. I play them with a keyboard (the musical instrument, not the desk keys), sometimes I set them by hand with the mouse. I use the open source software Ardour for this. My stems can be used under a Creative Commons License BY NC. Credit me, and use my music for non-commercial purposes only.
